# Supply List

The only required supplies for VxPollBook are:

* [ ] Thermal paper rolls
* [ ] Security seals
* [ ] USB drives (depending on your usage)

## Thermal Paper Rolls

The thermal printer takes receipt rolls that are 3 1/8" wide. The maximum diameter for rolls is 3 1/4", which equates to lengths of 230' or 220'. These sizes are standard and available from a large number of vendors.

We recommend [POSSupply.com](https://www.possupply.com/thermal-receipt-roll-paper/3-1-8-thermal-paper-rolls) as one potential vendor. They sell thermal paper rolls in a variety of colors. Purchase links:

* [White - 50 Rolls](https://www.possupply.com/3-1-8-x-230-thermal-roll-paper-50-rolls-case?quantity=1\&custcol_autoreorder_frequency=5)
* [Yellow - 50 Rolls](https://www.possupply.com/3-1-8-x-230-yellow-thermal-roll-paper-50-rolls-case-bpa-free)
* [Green - 50 Rolls](https://www.possupply.com/3-1-8-x-230-green-thermal-roll-paper-50-rolls-case-bpa-free?quantity=1\&custcol_autoreorder_frequency=5)

Regardless of vendor, the lowest purchasable quantity is typically 50.&#x20;

## Security Seals

We recommend using the same seals you are using for your voting system to reduce the number of supplies you need to buy. If you're not using seals in your voting system, you can buy any heavy duty pull-tight seals from a reputable vendor, such as [seals.com](https://seals.com/heavy-duty-pull-tight-seals-model-9001/?sku=PLAS-9001-PRT-CU-GR-8\&gad_source=1\&gad_campaignid=20415733424\&gbraid=0AAAAADMynTxILryxQxTM7BMh-vqGgUoyn\&gclid=CjwKCAjwup3HBhAAEiwA7euZuq46vC0yfxX5A9GY5jwhdEpLJFPSh8jUN1qn3iPoFiT0nCIWvoR8NRoCcLsQAvD_BwE).&#x20;

## USB Drives

USB drives are provided by VotingWorks with the initial VxPollBook purchase. Depending on your jurisdiction's rules and regulations, you may either re-use the USB drives across elections or buy new USB drives for each election.

We recommend the [SanDisk Ultra Flair USB 3.0 Flash Drive](https://shop.sandisk.com/products/usb-flash-drives/sandisk-ultra-flair-usb-3-0?sku=SDCZ73-064G-G46). Other flash drives will likely work but are not recommended.

If you choose to re-use the drives, you may clear them before an election by following these steps:

* [ ] log into VxPollBook as a system administrator
* [ ] select `Settings`
* [ ] select `Format USB Drive`
