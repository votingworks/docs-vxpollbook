# Election Day Setup Checklist

Use this checklist to set up all VxPollBooks at the precinct on or just before election day.

## Hardware Setup

* [ ] Set up power strips and extensions cords such that you have two outlets available for each VxPollBook station you plan to set up

For each VxPollBook:

* [ ] Complete the [hardware-setup.md](hardware-setup.md "mention") , including loading printer paper
* [ ] Confirm that there are no yellow warning symbols in the top bar, which would indicate something is not connected
* [ ] Confirm that there is a lightning bolt symbol in the top bar, which indicates that the laptop is charging

## Network Check

For each VxPollBook:

* [ ] Confirm that the number of connected poll books (in the top bar) matches the number of poll books you have set up

If some poll books aren't seeing one another, try moving them closer, or clicking the network icon and then clicking `Reset Network` .

## Miscellaneous

* [ ] Confirm that you have the necessary poll worker and election manager cards to unlock VxPollBook
* [ ] Confirm that you have extra thermal paper printer rolls on hand
* [ ] If any voters have died shortly before election day, election managers should mark then as "Inactive" in VxPollBook. see the instructions in the [election-manager-election-day-guide.md](election-manager-election-day-guide.md "mention")
