# Emergency Paper Backup

VxPollBook includes an emergency paper backup feature in case of catastrophic failure affecting a majority of poll books. A USB drive should be attached to VxPollBook at all times. If a USB drive is not connected, the top bar will show a warning icon next to the USB icon:

While the USB drive is connected, VxPollBook will export a PDF version of the voter checklist, formatted to meet New Hampshire requirements:

The PDF can be directly printed from the USB drive at a high-speed color printer sold as an add-on for VxPollBook, specifically the HP Color LaserJet Enterprise M554dn.

Larger jurisdictions may use two printers, to allow printing both halves of the checklist in parallel, while smaller jurisdictions will use only one.

## Pre-Election Preparation

For each printer:

1. Set up the printer on a table near your polling place
2. Connect and power on the printer
3. Set the printing to default to one-sided
4. Load printer tray with paper
5. Print a test page

## Emergency Printing Procedure

Specific procedures will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally:

1. Remove the USB drive from one of the VxPollBooks
2. Repeat the following for each printer:
   1. Insert the USB drive into the USB port
   2. Select "USB Drive" on screen
   3. Select the name of the backup checklist. If using multiple printers, select _part\_1\_backup\_voter\_checklist.pdf_ for the first printer, _part\_2\_backup\_voter\_checklist.pdf_ for the second printer, and so on.
   4. Select "Print"
3. While printing, watch the printer(s) for any notifications that extra paper needs to be loaded
4. Once printed, split up the printed checklist according to the appropriate alphabetical splits
5. Find all receipts with a receipt number higher than the receipt number in the top right corner of the checklist. Manually update the checklist with the information on these receipts.
